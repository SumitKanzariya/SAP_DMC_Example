    - If you don't have a user, you need to [register](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) for a free.
    - Wait for the completion of the on-boarding.
5. You should land on the **Subaccounts** page of your **Global Account** on trial.
6. Choose **trial**.
7. From the **Navigation area**, choose Security **Trust Configuration**.

### Step 2 - Enable Kyma in Trial Account

You need an SAP BTP Subaccount with consumption-based model (that is, Cloud Credits). 

For this tutorial you have two options:

#### Option 1: Create Your Own SAP BTP Trial Account

1. Go to [SAP BTP Cockpit](https://cockpit.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/trial/#/home/trial).
2. Choose **Go To Your Trial Account**.
5. You should land on the **Subaccounts** page of your **Global Account** on trial.
6. Choose **trial**.
13. Go to **Kyma Environment**.
14. Choose **Enable Kyma**.
15. Provide a **Cluster Name**.
16. Choose **Create**.

This takes a while. You can start the tutorial in the meantime.

#### Option 2: Use Your Existing SAP BTP Subaccount

If you already have an older trial account, then you might not see the **Enable Kyma** button. In that case:

1. Go to **Entitlements**.
2. Choose **Configure Entitlements**.
3. Choose **Add Service Plans**.
4. Search for and select **Kyma runtime**.
5. Check the **trial** (Environment) checkbox.
6. Choose **Add 1 Service Plan**.
7. Choose **Enable Kyma**.
8. Provide a **Cluster Name**.
9. Choose **Create**.
This takes a while. You can start the tutorial in the meantime.

### Step 3 - Assign Kyma Roles to User

SAP BTPâ€™s XSUAA is used to access the Kyma runtime. Please follow the steps to [assign Roles in the Kyma Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/148ae38b7d6f4e61bbb696bbfb3996b2.html).

### Step 4 - Getting started with Business Application Studio

SAP Business Application Studio is a development environment available on SAP Business Technology Platform. To get started, please follow the link: [https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html)

### Step 5 - Install SAP Plant Connectivity
With SAP Plant Connectivity (PCo), SAP provides a software component that enables the exchange of data between an SAP system and the industry-specific standard data sources of different manufacturers, for example, process control systems, plant Historian systems, and SPC systems.

Follow this link for more details [SAP Plant Connectivity](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c90214be0d934ebdb6f3bce29c63c0ff/15.5.0/en-US/46a00344d44852b7e10000000a155369.html?q=plant%20connectivity)


### Step 6 - Install SAP Cloud Connector
Configure a cloud connector that acts as a reverse invoke proxy between an on-premises network and SAP Business Technology Platform. The cloud connector comes standard as part of the SAP Cloud Integration service and serves as a link between SAP Business Technology Platform and on-premise systems such as SAP S/4HANA.

![Screenshot](assets/how-to-setup-cloud-connection.png)

Follow this link for more details [Setting Up the Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c86ca4026fae4cb3ba66ed751866175b/latest/en-US/ef206b74c1dd416caf1e0fa555a2441f.html#c89cabe21cee42b2be3380bb887a9c3a.html)

### Step 7 - Configure Machine Model in DMC
SAP Plant Connectivity is the connectivity layer between SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud and the shop floor. As SAP Plant Connectivity is installed on the customer's premises, a cloud connector is required for the communication from SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud to SAP Plant Connectivity. In addition, the communication needs to be secured by valid certificates.

Follow this link for more details [Integrate with SAP Plant Connectivity](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c86ca4026fae4cb3ba66ed751866175b/latest/en-US/2aaac1f5ed104ffb850ede5942d7031d.html?q=plant%20connectivity)

### Step 8 - Integration with SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA (Optional)
SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud for execution uses SAP Cloud Integration to communicate with external SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA systems. You can connect various ERP systems, for example one system per plant or country. The global SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud for execution system is used across all plants.

![Screenshot](assets/Integration with SAP ERP.png)

Follow this link for more details [Integration with SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c86ca4026fae4cb3ba66ed751866175b/latest/en-US/351c4ef7bb4c4c4a8d7f9562988575c5.html)

### Step 9 - Load DMC Demo Data to be done by SAP team
We will be loading the basic data that will be needed for bootcamp excercise and for this we need create key Digital manufacturing instance and you can follow this [link](https://help.sap.com/viewer/34f67db3b755405e8145c578221f012c/latest/en-US/29d18581dab1438c92a79f28adcc8142.html#loio29d18581dab1438c92a79f28adcc8142__subsection-im5) to get or create the key as needed.

### Step 10 - Postman collection for DMC

This is the collection from [SAP API Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPDigitalManufacturingCloud/rest), you can also download the below collection to work with postman.
