# Unit 1 - Digital Manufacturing Cloud Extensibility Overview

## Overview
The DMC Extensibility Bootcamp is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience developing and deploying simple DMC extensions.  The bootcamp will be delivered through a combination of live instruction of extensibility topics and several exercises to highlight how DMC extensions can be used to enhance or replace standard DMC functionality.  Extensibility use cases will be discussed in detail and applied to individual processes in a business case for a discrete manufacturing assembly scenario, however all discussed use cases apply to process industry scenarios as well.
